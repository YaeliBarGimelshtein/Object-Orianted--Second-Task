Issues we know about:

1. Objects that inherits from Citizen will allways have a NULL Ballot.
2. Objects that inherits from Citizen will allways get the first ballot in the matching array
since there was no explenation about the logics- how citizen gets a ballot when there is 
more than one for each type. Our solution was just to give them the first ballot.
